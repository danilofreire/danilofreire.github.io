## Brown, Job Description

As a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Brown University, I fulfilled an integral role by designing and delivering two comprehensive courses: Political Research Methods and Political Violence.

In the Political Research Methods course, I introduced students to a range of statistical methods and imparted skills in R programming. The curriculum spanned from descriptive statistics to sophisticated causal inference methodologies such as regression discontinuity design, differences-in-differences, and randomised controlled trials. All materials related to this course can be accessed via https://pols1600.github.io/. The student evaluations of this course were overwhelmingly positive.

The second course, Political Violence, provided an in-depth exploration of the causes and repercussions of various forms of political violence including terrorism, coups d'état, and mass state violence. Course materials can be found at https://danilofreire.github.io/pols1824w/, along with comprehensive student evaluations, which testify to the course's academic value and the effectiveness of my teaching approach.

Concurrently, I was actively involved in extensive research activities. During my tenure at Brown, I produced a number of academic articles. Further, I conducted research that was later published in articles after assuming the position of Senior Lecturer at the University of Lincoln. I successfully managed a team of 10 bilingual research assistants for a project commissioned by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. This initiative involved conducting a survey experiment across 10 Latin American countries and was later published as an article in the Journal of Experimental Political Science.

In addition to my teaching and research responsibilities, I showcased strong skills in securing research funding, and I also engaged in productive collaborations with scholars from Brown University and other institutions worldwide. 

## Qualifications: 

My academic credentials span a range of disciplines, yet they all converge on a focus in policing and security studies. I have been awarded a PhD in Politics from the Department of Political Economy at King's College London, an MA in International Relations from the Graduate Institute in Geneva, and an MA in Political Science from the University of São Paulo. Irrespective of the varied domains of these qualifications, my line of inquiry has remained steadfastly on security issues and policing.

In the process of completing my initial Master's degree, I authored a quantitative paper that investigated the impact of executive power competitiveness on the incidence of civil wars. At the Graduate Institute, my dissertation involved the construction of a game-theoretical model that explored the recruitment dynamics within prison gangs. During my doctoral research, I composed three distinct essays centred around policing and violence. The first essay involved an examination of a violence-reduction programme in my home state, employing the synthetic control method. The subsequent essay presented a machine learning approach to anticipate state violence onset. The final essay offered a qualitative dissection of a widespread illicit numbers game in Brazil.

Complementing my academic achievements, I have earned the distinction of being an Associate Fellow at the Higher Education Academy (HEA), a recognition I secured during my initial year of tenure at the University of Lincoln (PR240832). I am presently looking forward to embarking on the pursuit of a more advanced HEA certification in the upcoming academic year.

## Experience: 

In my position as Senior Lecturer in Criminology, I have consistently followed a comprehensive research agenda focused on policing and security studies. This is manifested in my academic contributions to internationally respected journals. These include a survey experiment on lynchings and support for vigilantism published in Research and Politics, an impact evaluation of anti-homicide policies using synthetic control methods featured in Latin American Research Review, and a qualitative examination of an illicit gambling operation in Brazil presented in Latin American Perspectives. Further, my research on prison gangs has been included in the Handbook of Corrections in the United States (Routledge, London), and I've created an R package that collates and processes data from the Prison Brief project. I am currently engaged in two research projects on the influence of body-worn cameras on crime and racial disparities in police violence. 

In terms of acquiring external funding, esteemed organisations including Google, the John Templeton Foundation, the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, and the Getulio Vargas Foundation have extended their support to my research pursuits. This not only testifies to my ability to secure external funding but also underscores my potential to conduct impactful research. For instance, my collaboration with the São Paulo Military Police Academy in Brazil, funded by a research grant from Brown University, exemplifies the policy impact of my research.

In my lecturing role, I have exhibited a steadfast commitment to delivering engaging and high-quality education in policing studies. I coordinate and instruct the module "Policing Crime and Deviance", which introduces Criminology students to policing studies at my institution. This module, which I have entirely restructured apart from assessment types (due to departmental requirement), has consistently received high commendations from students. Moreover, my experience in delivering courses to police officers attests to my ability to translate complex academic concepts into practical, policy-oriented terms.

I have also successfully supervised student research projects at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, focusing primarily on policing issues in developing countries. The completion of Master's dissertations under my tutelage, and my ongoing supervision of postgraduate students at the University of Lincoln, corroborates this. These endeavours reflect my expertise in policing methods and organised crime in Latin America, contributing significantly to the diversity of topics available at my current institution.

To enhance students' employability and understanding of career options, I have designed my modules to be empirically grounded and problem-oriented from a policing perspective. This approach equips students with the necessary critical thinking skills and professional competencies required for their future careers. I have also delivered online modules as a guest lecturer for the MA in Economics at Universidad Francisco Marroquin (Guatemala), underscoring my adaptability in teaching modalities.

Presently, I serve as the departmental representative for the Master of Arts programme in Criminology and Criminal Justice, fostering a meaningful collaboration between the department and the university's Law School. This role has enabled me to enrich the academic experience for our students.

On the administrative side, I have actively contributed to the management of the academic department through my participation in departmental meetings, committees, and my role as a representative. I am eager to bring this wealth of experience and skill set to the position of a Senior Lecturer in Policing.

## Skills and abilities:

Throughout my academic tenure, I have consistently maintained strong and productive working relationships with my colleagues. This is exemplified in the numerous modules I have co-taught with various colleagues, the collaborative research projects we have undertaken, and my invitations to deliver guest lectures in their modules. Furthermore, my teaching performance has consistently received commendations from students, which is a testament to the quality of these collaborations and my dedication to pedagogical excellence. 

Being a Brazilian national myself, I am deeply cognisant of the unique needs and challenges faced by international students. Over the years, I have had the privilege of teaching a diverse array of students, including those from the Global South. This experience has honed my ability to communicate effectively across cultural, linguistic, and educational divides. My teaching experience spans multiple countries including the United States, Guatemala, and the United Kingdom, further broadening my understanding of the diverse needs of students from varied backgrounds. In addition, I place high value on accessibility and inclusivity; to this end, I offer office hours at varied times to accommodate part-time working students and ensure they have ample opportunity to engage with me on course-related discussions.

In terms of administrative and organisational skills, I have demonstrated strong capabilities through my role in the Criminology department. I understand the unique complexities of working within such an interdisciplinary context, and I recognise the necessity for a comprehensive, yet cohesive approach to teaching, research, and administrative tasks. My academic background in Politics, International Relations, and Political Science, juxtaposed with my focus on policing and security studies, has equipped me with the ability to forge meaningful linkages across these diverse fields. Consequently, I have been able to contribute significantly to the Department of Sociology and Criminology.

With these skills and abilities, I am confident in my capacity to assume the role of Senior Lecturer in Policing, continuing to enhance the academic environment through diligent research, innovative teaching, and effective administrative contributions.

## Research experience:

My academic pursuits address the complex challenges that developing nations confront when addressing collective action issues in public safety and the elimination of political violence. My work is guided by significant themes such as public service provision, homicide prevention, criminal governance, and state violence. I also harbour a particular interest in policy evaluation and assessment, and have developed a robust set of research skills to investigate these areas.

In conducting my research, I employ a range of methods including survey experiments, specifically those crafted for sensitive subjects, field experiments, machine learning algorithms, and qualitative analysis of historical records. I am a firm advocate for the value of multimethod approaches, choosing the most suitable one depending on the problem at hand. While experimental and quasi-experimental tools provide the most potent means to evaluate the impact of police and security interventions, machine learning methods have a significant role in offering predictive tools for police officers to implement more effective policies in real time. Furthermore, qualitative research offers valuable insights into potential mechanisms and public perceptions of specific policies or events, contributing significantly to studies in policing. My use of these diverse methodologies is evident in my extensive list of publications.

When it comes to research leadership, I have demonstrated my capability by leading a team of bilingual researchers and fostering collaborations with authors from various countries and academic institutions. My leadership skills in such diverse and multicultural settings have proven to be invaluable, fostering a robust and enriching exchange of ideas and ensuring comprehensive insights into the research issues. I believe that such a diverse team not only improves the quality of research but also prepares the ground for innovations that can have far-reaching impacts.

In addition, through my recent projects with the São Paulo Military Police, I have honed my skills in engaging with various stakeholders and public officials, as well as effectively communicating my findings to diverse audiences. My work with such projects has allowed me to navigate through the complexities of coordinating with different entities, managing logistics, and understanding the nuances of implementing research findings in practical settings. This experience has also helped me appreciate the importance of effective communication in ensuring that the outcomes of research reach the right stakeholders and lead to impactful policies.

Finally, my future research agenda is poised to broaden the current understanding of policing in under-researched areas of the Global South. This not only provides opportunities for fresh insights and breakthroughs in policing studies but also contributes to the broader goal of addressing security issues and political violence in these regions. By focusing on these less-explored areas, my research aims to build a more inclusive understanding of public security issues, thereby helping to shape more effective and culturally sensitive policing policies worldwide.

## Teaching experience: 

As a Senior Lecturer at the University of Lincoln, I have had the privilege to instruct a variety of modules, each presenting unique opportunities for student engagement and learning.

The module "Policing Crime and Deviance" has been particularly enriching, catering to 70-90 second-year undergraduate Criminology students and attracting interest from the broader School of Social and Political Sciences. This comprehensive 30-credit module delves into the complex dynamics of policing, focusing on the societal response to crime and deviance and the unequal distribution of security services. The curriculum encourages students to critically reflect on themes such as state protection, social inequality, and the increasing influence of private policing. To facilitate this exploration, I have employed an array of instructional strategies, incorporating expository lectures, in-depth seminar discussions, and the careful use of multimedia resources like documentaries and films. Assessments for this module consist of a critical essay and an academic conference presentation, challenging students to articulate their understanding and viewpoints in a public academic setting. The successful delivery of this course for two consecutive years stands as a testament to my teaching proficiency.

My role as the main lecturer for the module "Human Rights" presented a larger classroom setting of approximately 200 students across the School of Social and Political Sciences. This third-year core module provides a thorough overview of national and international human rights protections. The curriculum covers a wide range of groups, from women and indigenous populations to children and refugees. In my lectures, I have endeavored to provide historical context, elucidate current legislation, and spark thoughtful discussion about the strengths and limitations of contemporary rights protections. As a seminar leader, I stimulated further discourse, prompting students to delve into specific cases of rights violations and construct potential resolutions. The final assessment, a human rights report on a chosen violation, encourages students to apply their knowledge in a practical and impactful way.

Lastly, I serve as a seminar leader for the "Applying Criminology" module, which hosts approximately 120 second-year Criminology students. This module provides a comprehensive exploration of criminological theories, tracing the evolution of thought from classicism and biological positivism to the latest developments in critical theory and zemiology. The seminar discussions are designed to be practical and engaging, encouraging students to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world case studies and scenarios. In this environment, each seminar group of around 20 students thrives on collaboration and critical discussion.

Throughout these modules, I have emphasised the importance of the Socratic method and the concept of the "student as producer" as crucial tools for creating an energising, dynamic, and productive learning environment. I firmly believe in the value of dialogue-based learning, as it cultivates critical thinking, intellectual engagement, and fosters a setting conducive to lively debate and meaningful discourse. I have found that stimulating questions, problem-solving discussions, and inquisitive dialogues encourage students to probe deeper, forging their unique interpretations of complex subjects.

Furthermore, I take great pride in cultivating a diverse, inclusive, and respectful classroom atmosphere. Recognising that each student brings their unique experiences and skills to the learning environment, I continuously leverage this diversity to enhance learning outcomes. This approach enriches our understanding of the course material and prepares students for a future in an increasingly diverse world.
