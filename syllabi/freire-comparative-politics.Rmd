# Course Description

The objective of this class is to introduce students to the growing field of Comparative Politics. In particular, the course focuses on the relationship between political institutions and economic performance. We analyse how political systems foster or hinder economic growth, and the ways in which corruption, clientelism, and political violence affect the welfare of the citizenry.

Although many of the readings use formal models or statistical methods to develop their arguments, no previous knowledge of game theory or quantitative methods is required. Feel free to skip the technical parts if they are too challenging and focus on the main ideas of the readings.

# Course Information

It is very important that you read the assigned readings before class. Students are encouraged to engage in critical discussions and are most welcome to express their views openly and freely. I would suggest you to bring some notes to the class so that we can discuss together the topics you find most interesting. 

All information about the course will be available at [http://danilofreire.github.io](http://danilofreire.github.io). The syllabus will be updated periodically according to the progress of the class. Please remember to visit the website regularly.

# Office Hours

I am very flexible when it comes to office hours, but it is easier to contact me via email. Feel free to send me a message any time at [danilofreire@gmail.com](mailto:danilofreire@gmail.com). I will reply in a few hours. You can also meet me in the afternoon at my office. If possible, please send me an email before coming to my office just to make sure two students will not book the same time slot.

# Community Standards

I am committed to full inclusion of all students. Please inform me early in the term if you have a disability or other conditions that might require accommodations or modification of any of these course procedures. You may speak with me after class or during office hours. Students in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact one of the deans in the Dean of the College office.

# English Language Learners

The university welcomes students from around the country and the world, and the unique perspectives international and multilingual students bring enrich the campus community. To empower multilingual learners, an array of support is available including language and culture workshops and individual appointments. No student will be penalised for their command of the English language.

# Academic Integrity

Students will write three review reports and a longer essay for this course. All writing should be your own work, and I take plagiarism very seriously. I am happy to provide any help you may require with your lessons as long as you are committed to the course. It is also important to cite other people's work whenever necessary, and if in doubt, mention your sources. 

# Special Needs

If you have any special needs, please contact me. I'm happy to make necessary arrangements so you can follow this course.

# Requirements and Grading 

**Participation: 15%.**  Students should be active participants in the course. Feel free to ask any question you may have, help others if you know how, and make suggestions or comments you believe are interesting. I hope we create a friendly, open environment for learning and students are the most important part of it.

**Three Review Reports: 45%.**  The reviews should be 3-5 pages long. Imagine you are a reviewer for a good academic journal and think of how you could help the author improve the article. Are the arguments well-developed in the text? Is the research design plausible? What further examples could the author include to strenghten his/her arguments? Try to provide as much constructive criticism as possible. You don't need to summarise the paper, just critically engage with it. The essays are due at the beginning of the class and late assignments will not be eligible for an A. Each report will account for 15% of your grade.

**Final Project: 40%.** In the final project, students will have the opportunity to write a longer essay about a topic that interests them. The essay should be related to the readings of the course, but you are particularly encouraged to explore new ideas and use new data to test their hypotheses. Students can work in groups of up to three people as most academic research is currently done collaboratively. By the second week of the course, students should submit a one-page summary of their future essay. The instructor and two colleagues will review the paper proposal and give the authors constructive feedback. Students will then write a full draft during the term. In the last week of the course, students will present their findings to the class and receive feedback from their colleagues. The final paper is due one week after that.
